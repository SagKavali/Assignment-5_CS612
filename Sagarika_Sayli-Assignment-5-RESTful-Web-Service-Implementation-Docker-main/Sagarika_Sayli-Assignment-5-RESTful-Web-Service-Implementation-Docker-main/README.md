#RESTful webservice using Docker

Created a RESTful Web service that displays data of students in JSON format using four get routes: 
   
* /students
   
* /students/year

* /Student/year/class

* /Student/year/class/Subject
    
Steps to run RESTful web service:

* A Docker Image is created by running the following command: -
 "docker build -t flaskapp . "


* Run the created students-image image inside a container using the following command
  "docker run -d -p 50:5001 flaskapp" 

* Check running docker container by "docker ps"

* App will now be running at the following address: -
  http://0.0.0.0:5000/Students
  
* For specific Id use the following url
  http://0.0.0.0:5000/students/2018  --- (2018 is the id you wish to search)
